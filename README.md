A useful command line interface for SilverStripe developers.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6 or above
* SilverStripe 4.x or above
* Composer

## Installation

### With Composer

It is recommended to install this module globally with composer:

```shell
composer global require silverleague/silverstripe-console
```

Ensure your composer's `bin` folder has been added to your system path.

You can still require this module as a project dependency if you don't want to install it globally, of course.

### From source

If you wish to install this module from source, you can clone the repository and symlink `bin/ssconsole` into your system path, for example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:silverleague/silverstripe-console.git
cd silverstripe-console
chmod u+x bin/console
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/ssconsole" /usr/local/bin/ssconsole
```

## Usage

### Commands

To show the console menu and list of commands, run `ssconsole` from your terminal.

### Running commands

To run a command, choose the desired command from the menu and add it as an argument:

```shell
# Runs a task
ssconsole dev:tasks:cleanup-test-databases

# Builds the database and flushed the manifest/cache
ssconsole dev:build --flush
```

### Flushing the manifest

Sometimes you need to flush SilverStripe's manifest/cache while running CLI tasks. For example, if you've added a new `BuildTask`, but it doesn't show up in the SilverStripe console yet.

You can add the `--flush` option to any `ssconsole` command to instruct SilverStripe to flush and rebuild its manifest.
